A multi theme, completely accessible, with components and pages examples, ready for production dashboard.

ðŸ§ª [See it live](https://zamanz.github.io/tailwind-dashboard/public/index.html)

## ðŸš€ Usage

Clone or download this repo and everything you need is inside the `public` folder.

## ðŸ¦® Accessibility

This dashboard was developed with a11y in mind since the beginning.

1. Every text passes the WCAG Level AA (at least)
2. It is completely keyboard navigable
3. I actually used [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) to read my screen during development

## ðŸ”® Future

In the next days I'll release the React _and_ Vue versions of it, soon after finishing these tasks:

TODO

- [ ] Make charts accessible through hidden data
- [ ] Refactor and split `shadow-outline-<color>` plugin
- [ ] Paginate tables with Alpine
- [ ] Focus first element when dropdowns are opened
- [x] Add roles to the table

## OSS used

(TODO: add links)

- Tailwind CSS
- Tailwind Forms
